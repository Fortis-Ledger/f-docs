# DAO Governance

FortisArena operates as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), giving FRT token holders direct control over platform development, treasury management, and ecosystem decisions.

## What is the FortisArena DAO?

The DAO is a governance system where:

- **Token holders propose** changes to the platform
- **Community votes** on proposals using FRT tokens
- **Smart contracts execute** approved decisions automatically
- **Treasury funds** are allocated through transparent voting

```

## Governance Principles

### 1. Transparency

All governance actions are public:
- Proposal details on-chain
- Voting records verifiable
- Treasury movements tracked
- Execution automated

### 2. Inclusivity

Anyone with FRT can participate:
- No minimum voting amount
- Delegation allowed
- Multiple proposal types
- Educational resources provided

### 3. Security

Multiple safeguards protect the DAO:
- Time delays for major changes
- Multi-signature requirements
- Emergency pause functionality
- Regular security audits

## Voting Power

### How Voting Power is Calculated

Your voting power depends on:

| Factor | Weight | Description |
|:-------|:-------|:------------|
| **FRT Holdings** | Base | 1 FRT = 1 vote base |
| **Staking Multiplier** | ×1.0 to ×2.0 | Longer stake = more voting power |
| **Participation Bonus** | +5-10% | Regular voters earn bonus |
| **Delegation** | Full | Receive votes from others |

### Voting Power Examples

|:---------|:---------|:---------------|:-------------|
| New holder | 10,000 | Flexible | 10,000 |
| Silver staker | 10,000 | 90 days | 12,500 |
