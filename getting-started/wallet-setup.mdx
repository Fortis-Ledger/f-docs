# Wallet Setup Guide

> **No MetaMask. No Trust Wallet. No Seed Phrases. Platform provides everything.**

FortisArena has its own **internal wallet system** that is automatically created when you sign up. You don't need any external Web3 wallet to use the platform.

---

## 🎯 Quick Start (Recommended)

### For New Users: Just Sign Up!

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Account">
    Sign up with Email, Google, Apple, or Phone
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Wallet Auto-Creates">
    Your wallet is automatically generated—no setup needed!
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Get Your UID">
    You'll receive a UID: `FORTIS-UID-XXXX`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start Using">
    Receive funds, send transfers, join tournaments immediately
  </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** No external apps, no seed phrases, no complicated setup.

## How Internal Wallet Works

### What You Get

| Feature | Internal Wallet |
|:--------|:----------------|
| **Setup** | Automatic on signup |
| **Recovery** | Email/Phone verification |
| **Security** | MPC (Multi-Party Computation) |
| **Transfers** | Free, instant (UID to UID) |
| **Seed Phrase** | ❌ Not needed |
| **Private Key** | ❌ Not exposed to user |

### Your UID (User Identifier)

Instead of complex wallet addresses, you get a simple UID:

```
Format: FORTIS-UID-XXXX
Example: FORTIS-UID-7842
```

**Use UID for:**
- Receiving payments from other users
- Internal transfers (free & instant)
- Tournament registrations
- Support tickets

<Info>
  **UID vs Wallet Address**
  
  - **UID**: `FORTIS-UID-7842` — Easy, for platform use
  - **Wallet Address**: `0x742d...` — Complex, for external blockchain
  
  For internal transfers, use UID. For external crypto deposits/withdrawals, use wallet address.
</Info>
