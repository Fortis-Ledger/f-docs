## 🎯 Core Use Cases

### 1️⃣ Access Staking — Unlock Platform Power

Stake FRT to access premium platform features. The more you stake, the more responsibility you take on.

#### Organization Registration

| Requirement | FRT Stake | Unlock |
|:------------|:----------|:-------|
| **Esports Organization** | 50,000 FRT | Official org status, roster management |
| **Tournament Organizer** | 25,000 FRT | Host custom tournaments |
| **Content Network** | 10,000 FRT | Creator program, monetization tools |

#### Tournament Entry Fees

Players pay tournament entry fees in **FRT** (not FPT). This ensures serious competition:

| Tournament Tier | Entry Fee | Est. USD Value |
|:----------------|:----------|:---------------|
| **Amateur** | 10 FRT | ~$1-2 |
| **Semi-Pro** | 50 FRT | ~$5-10 |
| **Pro** | 200 FRT | ~$20-40 |
| **Elite** | 500 FRT | ~$50-100 |
| **Legend** | 2,500 FRT | ~$250-500 |

<Note>
  **Entry fees = FRT** | **Prizes = Mostly FPT (occasionally FRT for major events)**
</Note>

#### Tournament Hosting

| Tournament Size | FRT Required | Features Unlocked |
|:----------------|:-------------|:------------------|
| **Small (8-32 teams)** | 5,000 FRT | Basic brackets, standard prizes |
| **Medium (32-128 teams)** | 15,000 FRT | Advanced formats, custom rules |
| **Large (128+ teams)** | 50,000 FRT | Pro features, sponsored prizes |
| **International** | 100,000 FRT | Maximum visibility, LAN support |

#### Guild Expansion

| Guild Tier | Members | FRT Required | Perks |
|:-----------|:--------|:-------------|:------|
| **Tier 1** | 30 | Free | Basic guild features |
| **Tier 2** | 50 | 5,000 FRT | Expanded roster, minor perks |
| **Tier 3** | 100 | 15,000 FRT | Guild tournaments, analytics |
| **Tier 4** | 250 | 50,000 FRT | Priority support, featured status |
| **Tier 5** | 500 | 150,000 FRT | Maximum benefits, partner status |

#### Other Access Features

| Feature | FRT Stake | Benefit |
|:--------|:----------|:--------|
| **Advanced Analytics** | 2,000 FRT | Detailed player/team statistics |
| **Higher Withdrawal Limits** | 1,000 FRT | Increased daily/monthly caps |

| **API Access** | 10,000 FRT | Developer tools, integrations |
| **Priority Support** | 2,000 FRT | Faster response times |

<Note>
  **Important**: Staking FRT gives you **access**, not returns. The value is in the utility unlocked, not financial yield.
</Note>

### 2️⃣ Lock & Burn Mechanism

When FRT is used for platform features, it undergoes lock/burn mechanics that create supply pressure.

#### How It Works

```
User pays 10,000 FRT for Organization Registration
                ↓
        ┌───────┴───────┐
        ↓               ↓
    2,000 FRT      8,000 FRT
    (Burned)      (Time-Locked)
                      ↓
                Released over 1 year
                (for continued access)
```

#### Burn & Lock Rates

| Action | Burn % | Time-Locked % | Lock Duration |
|:-------|:-------|:--------------|:--------------|
| **Organization Registration** | 20% | 80% | 1 year |
| **Tournament Hosting** | 10% | 90% | 6 months |
| **Guild Expansion** | 15% | 85% | 1 year |
| **Feature Unlock** | 5% | 95% | 3 months |

**Effects:**
- **Burned tokens** = Permanent supply reduction
- **Locked tokens** = Reduced circulating supply
- **Combined** = Natural demand pressure without any payout obligations

---

### 3️⃣ Reputation Staking — Trust System

FRT serves as economic collateral for platform participants. This creates a hybrid Web2 + Web3 trust mechanism.

#### How Reputation Staking Works

```
Step 1: Organization stakes 50,000 FRT as collateral
Step 2: Organization hosts tournaments, manages guild
Step 3: If org commits fraud or allows cheating...
Step 4: Stake gets SLASHED (partial or full)
Step 5: Victims compensated from slashed FRT
```

#### Slashing Conditions

| Violation | Slashing % | Appeal |
|:----------|:-----------|:-------|
| **Tournament manipulation** | 100% | No |
| **Allowing cheaters** | 50-100% | Yes (review) |
| **Prize pool theft** | 100% | No |
| **Fraudulent org claims** | 100% | No |
| **Minor rule violations** | 10-25% | Yes |

#### Who Must Stake

| Role | Minimum Stake | Purpose |
|:-----|:--------------|:--------|
| **Tournament Host** | 25,000 FRT | Ensure fair play |
| **Esports Organization** | 50,000 FRT | Player protection |
| **Guild Master (Tier 3+)** | 5,000 FRT | Guild integrity |
| **Verified Influencer** | 10,000 FRT | Content authenticity |

<Info>
  **Why This Matters**: Economic collateral creates skin in the game. Organizations with more FRT staked have more to lose if they misbehave, creating natural accountability.
</Info>

### 4️⃣ Occasional Premium Rewards

While **FPT is the primary reward token** for daily tournaments and activities, **FRT is used for special, high-value rewards**:

#### When FRT is Used for Rewards

| Event Type | Reward Amount | Why FRT? |

| **International Championships** | 50,000-500,000 FRT | Prestige, major achievement |

<Note>

```
Platform Growth

More Tournament Hosts Need to Stake
      ↓
More Guilds Want to Expand
      ↓
Demand for FRT Increases
      ↓
Burn + Lock Mechanisms Reduce Supply
      ↓
Value Reflects Actual Platform Usage
```

**Key Value Drivers:**

1. **Organization Demand** — More orgs = More FRT needed
2. **Tournament Activity** — Hosting requires FRT stakes
3. **Guild Expansion** — Larger guilds need more FRT
4. **Burn Mechanics** — Permanent supply reduction
5. **Lock Mechanics** — Reduced circulating supply

**NOT Value Drivers:**

❌ Dividends or profit sharing  
❌ Guaranteed yield or APY  
❌ Company revenue
