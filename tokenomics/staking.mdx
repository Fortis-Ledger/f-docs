**Each stake is independent** with its own lock period and benefits.

  <Step title="Go to Dashboard">
    View your active stakes
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Stake">
    Click on matured stake (lock period completed)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Initiate Unstake">

| **FRT Staking** | 20% of staked amount | All unlocked features immediately |
| **FPT Staking** | 10% of staked amount | All perks immediately |

**Penalty Distribution:**
- 100% of penalty is **burned** (deflationary)
- No one receives the penalty amount

<Warning>
  **Think carefully before early unstaking.** You lose both tokens (penalty) and benefits immediately.

### What's the difference between FRT and FPT staking?

| Aspect | FRT Staking | FPT Staking |
|:-------|:------------|:------------|
| **Purpose** | Access power features | Get convenience perks |
| **Examples** | Org registration, hosting | Fee discounts, cosmetics |
| **Lock Periods** | Longer (3 months - 2 years) | Shorter (flexible - 180 days) |
| **Who Needs It** | Organizations, serious users | All players, creators |

### Can I have multiple stakes?

Yes! You can:
- Stake FRT in multiple tiers for different features
- Stake FPT separately for perks
- Have both FRT and FPT stakes active simultaneously

**No.** Staking is completely optional:
- Basic platform use: No staking required
- Social features: No staking required

- Advanced features: Staking required

### Can I lose my staked tokens?

3. **Smart contract hack** → Extremely unlikely, but possible

### How is this different from DeFi staking?

| DeFi Staking | FortisArena Staking |

## Risks & Considerations

### Lock Period Risk

Staked tokens cannot be accessed until the lock period ends (unless you pay the early penalty).

**Mitigation**: 
- Only stake what you don't need immediately
- Use flexible staking for uncertain situations
- Plan your token needs in advance

### Smart Contract Risk

While our contracts are audited, all smart contracts carry some risk.

**Protections**:
- Multiple professional audits
- Bug bounty program
- Emergency pause functionality
- Time-delayed on critical functions

### Benefit Change Risk

Platform benefits associated with staking tiers may change over time.

**Policy**:
- Grandfathering for existing stakes
- 30-day notice for major changes
- Community input on adjustments
