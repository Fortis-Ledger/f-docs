### 3️⃣ Spend Mechanics (Burn & Recycle)

When FPT is spent, it doesn't just disappear. It follows an economic model that balances deflation with sustainability.

#### The FPT Cycle

```
User spends FPT on platform
           ↓
    ┌──────┴──────┐
    ↓             ↓
  30% Burn     70% Recycled
 (Deflation)   (Reward Pool)
                      ↓
              Distributed as new
              tournament prizes,
              achievements, etc.
```

#### Burn vs Recycle by Category

| Spend Category | Burn % | Recycle % | Destination |
|:---------------|:-------|:----------|:------------|
| **Tournament Entry** | 30% | 70% | Prize pool |
| **Creator Tips** | 10% | 90% | Creator instantly |
| **Boosts** | 50% | 50% | Platform ops |
| **Cosmetics** | 100% | 0% | Permanent burn |
| **Guild Features** | 40% | 60% | Guild rewards |

**Why This Matters:**
- **Burn** = Deflationary pressure on FPT
- **Recycle** = Sustainable reward economy
- **Combined** = Long-term token health

### 4️⃣ Utility Staking (NOT Investment Staking)

Stake FPT to unlock platform benefits. This is **NOT** an investment — you earn utility perks, not financial returns.

<Warning>
  **NO APY PROMISES**
  
  Staking FPT gives you **platform benefits only**. There are no financial returns, no yield percentages, and no profit sharing.
</Warning>

#### Staking Tiers

| Stake Amount | Unlock Benefit | Duration |
|:-------------|:---------------|:---------|
| **1,000 FPT** | 5% tournament fee discount | While staked |
| **5,000 FPT** | Priority matchmaking queue | While staked |
| **10,000 FPT** | Free monthly cosmetic | While staked |
| **25,000 FPT** | Exclusive "Stakeholder" badge | While staked |
| **50,000 FPT** | Early access to new features | While staked |
| **100,000 FPT** | VIP support channel | While staked |

#### How Utility Staking Works

1. **Stake FPT** → Lock tokens in smart contract
2. **Unlock Perks** → Benefits activate immediately
3. **Maintain Stake** → Perks continue while staked
4. **Unstake Anytime** → Tokens returned (no penalty)
5. **Perks Lost** → Benefits stop upon unstaking

<Info>
  **Example**: Stake 5,000 FPT → Get priority matchmaking → Unstake whenever → No financial return, just utility while staked.

## 📈 FPT Economics

### What Drives FPT Value

FPT value comes from **platform usage demand**:

```
More Players → More Tournaments → More Entries Needed
                                    ↓
                              More FPT Demand
                                    ↓
                              Burn + Recycle
                                    ↓
                        Sustainable Token Economy
```

**Value Drivers:**

1. **Tournament Activity** — Entry fees require FPT
2. **Creator Economy** — Tips use FPT
3. **Guild Features** — Utilities cost FPT
4. **Burn Mechanics** — Permanent supply reduction
5. **User Growth** — More users = More demand

**NOT Value Drivers:**

❌ Financial returns or yield  
❌ Company revenue share  
❌ External investment promises  
❌ Speculative guarantees  

### FPT vs Traditional Gaming Currencies

| Aspect | Traditional (e.g., V-Bucks) | FPT |
|:-------|:----------------------------|:----|
| **Ownership** | Platform-controlled | User-owned on-chain |
| **Transferable** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Tradeable** | ❌ No | ✅ On DEXs |
| **Burn Transparent** | ❌ No | ✅ On-chain visible |
