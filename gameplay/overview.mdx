# Supported Games & Gameplay

FortisArena is a **multi-game competitive tournament platform**. We host tournaments across multiple game titles and genres — from FPS shooters to battle royales, MOBAs to sports sims.

<Note>
  FortisArena is **not a game itself** — it's a platform where players compete in existing popular game titles through organized tournaments with real prize pools.

## Game Modes

### Competitive (Prize Pool)

These modes are part of organized tournaments with real stakes:

- **Bracket Tournaments** — Scheduled events with elimination rounds
- **League Matches** — Season-long competitions with standings
- **LAN Qualifiers** — Regional offline events for major tournaments
- **Pro Circuit** — Invitation-only professional tournaments

### Practice (No Stakes)

These modes help you improve without risking entry fees:

- **Quick Match** — Casual ranked practice against similarly skilled players
- **Scrims** — Practice matches between squads (arranged by teams)
- **Custom Lobbies** — Private matches for guild practice or community events

---

## Matchmaking

FortisArena uses **Skill-Based Matchmaking (SBMM)** for practice modes:

| Feature | How It Works |
|:--------|:-------------|
| **Skill Rating** | Based on win rate, K/D, and recent performance |
| **Fair Matching** | Paired with opponents of similar skill level |
| **Anti-Smurf** | Rapidly promotes highly skilled new accounts to correct tier |
| **Region Priority** | Matches players in same region for low latency |

<Note>
  Tournament matches use **bracket/seeding systems** instead of matchmaking — you play whoever you're matched against in the bracket.
</Note>

## Anti-Cheat & Fair Play

| Layer | What It Does |
|:------|:-------------|
| **KYC Verification** | One account per person — no smurfs in tournaments |
| **Device Fingerprinting** | Detects multi-accounting |
| **Match Review** | AI + human review for flagged matches |
| **Result Verification** | Game results cross-checked before prize distribution |
| **Dispute System** | Players can contest results with evidence |
