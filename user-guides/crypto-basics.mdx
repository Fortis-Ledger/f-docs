# Crypto Basics for Gamers

New to cryptocurrency? This guide explains Web3 concepts and how FortisArena's wallet system works—no technical background needed.

---

## What is Web3?

### The Evolution of the Internet

| Web1 (1990s) | Web2 (2000s-present) | Web3 (Now) |
|:-------------|:---------------------|:-----------|
| Read-only | Read + Write | Read + Write + Own |
| Static pages | Social media, apps | User-owned data |
| Like a library | Like a multiplayer game | Like owning your items |

**Web3** = The internet where you own your digital assets and can take them anywhere.

---

## Key Concepts

### Blockchain
A digital ledger that records transactions across many computers. Think of it as a **global scoreboard** that:
- Everyone can see
- No one can cheat
- Records are permanent

### Cryptocurrency
Digital money that exists on the blockchain:
- **FRT** = FortisArena's access token
- **FPT** = FortisArena's rewards token
- Tradable for other currencies

### Smart Contracts
Code that automatically executes agreements:
- Tournament prizes distribute automatically
- No one can change the rules mid-game
- Results are transparent

## How FortisArena Wallet is Different

### Traditional Crypto Wallets

Most crypto platforms use wallets like MetaMask:

| Component | What It Is | Your Responsibility |
|:----------|:-----------|:--------------------|
| **Public Address** | Your wallet ID | Share to receive funds |
| **Private Key** | Secret password | Keep secure |
| **Seed Phrase** | 12-24 word backup | NEVER lose this |

**Problem**: Lose your seed phrase = Lose your funds forever. No customer support can help.

### FortisArena's MPC Wallet

We use **Multi-Party Computation (MPC)** technology:

| Feature | How It Works |
|:--------|:-------------|
| **Your UID** | Simple ID: `FORTIS-UID-XXXX` |
| **No Seed Phrase** | Recovery via email/phone |
| **Key Distribution** | Keys split across secure servers |
| **Platform Security** | We secure; you use |

**Advantage**: Forget password? We can help recover. No seed phrase to lose.

### Comparison

| Aspect | Traditional Wallet | FortisArena Wallet |
|:-------|:-------------------|:-------------------|
| **Setup** | Install app, backup seed phrase | Sign up, auto-created |
| **Recovery** | Seed phrase only | Email/phone verification |
| **Security** | Your responsibility | Shared responsibility |
| **Support** | None (you're on your own) | Full customer support |
| **Best For** | DeFi experts | Gamers, everyday users |

## Understanding Your UID

### What is a UID?

**UID** = User Identifier

```
Format: FORTIS-UID-XXXX
Example: FORTIS-UID-7842
```

### Using Your UID

| Action | How |
|:-------|:----|
| **Receive funds** | Share your UID |
| **Send funds** | Enter recipient's UID |
| **Internal transfers** | Free and instant |

### UID vs Wallet Address

| UID | Wallet Address |
|:----|:---------------|
| `FORTIS-UID-7842` | `0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb4` |
| For platform use | For blockchain use |
| Easy to remember | Complex |
| Free transfers | Network fees apply |

**For most FortisArena activities, use your UID.**
