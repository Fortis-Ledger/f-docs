## Recognizing Scams

### Common Scams

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="fish" title="Phishing (Fake Websites)">
    **How it works:**
    - Fake website looks identical to real one
    - URL is slightly different
    - Steals credentials when you log in
    
    **Examples:**
    - ❌ `fortis-arena.io` (fake)
    - ❌ `fortisarena.xyz` (fake)
    - ✅ `fortisarena.io` (real)
    - ✅ `app.fortisarena.io` (real)
    
    **Prevention:**
    - Bookmark official sites
    - Check URL carefully
    - Look for SSL lock (🔒)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="message-circle" title="Fake Support">
    **How it works:**
    - "Support agent" DMs you first
    - Asks for account info or wallet details
    - Offers to "help" with a problem
    
    **Red Flags:**
    - Anyone DMing you first claiming to be support
    - Asking for your password
    - Asking you to connect to "verification" websites
    - Pressure to act quickly
    
    **Remember:** Real FortisArena support will NEVER:
    - DM you first

    - Ask for your seed phrase
    - Ask you to send crypto for "verification"
  </Accordion>

    **How it works:**
    - "Send 1 FRT, get 2 FRT back"
    - Fake celebrity endorsements
    - Time pressure to "act now"
    
    **Reality:**
    - If it sounds too good to be true, it is
    - No one gives away free crypto for sending crypto
    - Legitimate giveaways never require sending funds first
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="code" title="Fake Apps">
    **How it works:**
    - Malicious browser extension
    - Fake mobile apps
    - Modified wallet software
    
    **Prevention:**
    - Only download from official sources
    - Check reviews and download counts
    - Verify publisher identity
  </Accordion>
