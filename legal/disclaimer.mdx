## 1. General Information Disclaimer

The information provided by FortisArena (the "Company," "we," "us," or "our") on our Service is for general informational purposes only. All information is provided in good faith; however, we make no representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied, regarding the accuracy, adequacy, validity, reliability, availability, or completeness of any information on the Service. **YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IS SOLELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

## 2. Not Financial, Investment, or Legal Advice

- **No Advice**: The Service, including any content, communication, documentation, or discussion on digital assets, tokens, NFTs, or the Web3 market, is NOT financial, investment, legal, tax, or professional advice.

- **No Fiduciary Relationship**: We do not act as your broker, dealer, financial advisor, or custodian. No information on the Service should be construed as an offer, solicitation, or recommendation to purchase or sell any digital asset or to engage in any investment strategy.

- **Independent Research**: You should conduct your own research and due diligence, and seek advice from a qualified financial advisor, tax advisor, or legal professional before making any financial decisions related to the Service.

## 3. Inherent Web3, Cryptocurrency, and Digital Asset Risks

By using the Service, you acknowledge and accept the following specific risks:

- **Extreme Volatility and Loss**: Digital assets are highly volatile and inherently risky. Their value can fluctuate wildly, and you could lose all or a substantial portion of your capital. We are not responsible for any losses incurred due to price volatility.

- **Smart Contract Risk**: Our Service relies on smart contracts. While we take measures to secure them, smart contracts are code and are susceptible to bugs, exploits, or failures. Any exploit of a smart contract could lead to the total loss of digital assets.

- **Regulatory Risk**: The regulatory environment for Web3, cryptocurrency, and NFTs is uncertain and rapidly changing across jurisdictions. New regulations could adversely affect the value of the assets, the operation of the Service, or your ability to use the platform.

- **Security Risk (Private Keys)**: The security of your cryptocurrency wallet depends entirely on the secrecy of your private keys/seed phrases. We do not hold or control your private keys. Any loss of private keys or compromise of your wallet due to user error or external attack is solely your responsibility.

- **Irreversible Transactions**: Blockchain transactions are generally irreversible. We cannot reverse, refund, or retrieve assets sent to incorrect wallet addresses or lost due to transaction errors.

- **Tax Compliance**: You are solely and personally responsible for determining and paying any and all taxes that apply to your transactions and any income derived from gaming, trading, or reward distribution on the Service. We do not provide tax advice.

## 4. Gaming and E-Sports Disclaimers

- **Fair Play and Bans**: We employ anti-cheat measures and reserve the right to ban or suspend any user found violating our Terms and Conditions (e.g., cheating, hacking, exploitation, or abusive behavior) without prior notice or compensation.

- **Server Stability**: We do not guarantee uninterrupted, secure, or error-free access to the game servers. We are not liable for any losses or damages resulting from server outages, lag, maintenance, or game-breaking bugs.

- **In-Game Asset Value**: Any items, currency, or progress acquired in the game are provided "as-is" and are subject to change, modification, or deletion by us at any time, especially if found to be the result of an exploit. We do not guarantee the transferability or real-world monetary value of any in-game items.

## 5. External Links Disclaimer

The Service may contain links to other websites or content belonging to or originating from third parties (e.g., Web3 exchanges, blockchain explorers). Such external links are not investigated, monitored, or checked for accuracy, adequacy, validity, reliability, availability, or completeness by us. We will not be a party to or in any way be responsible for monitoring any transaction between you and any third-party providers.

## 6. Limitation of Liability and No Warranties

**TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.**

**IN NO EVENT WILL WE OR OUR DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, OR AGENTS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFIT, LOST REVENUE, LOSS OF DATA, OR OTHER DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.**
