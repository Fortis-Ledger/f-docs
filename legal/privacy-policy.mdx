- **Account Management & Authentication**: To verify user identity, manage secure logins, and customize your user experience.

- **Performance and Analytics**: To monitor the efficiency of our smart contracts and infrastructure, and to analyze player behavior to balance and improve our games and services.

- **Security and Compliance**: To proactively detect, investigate, and prevent fraudulent activity, unauthorized access, cheating, and money laundering (AML) risks, especially given the financial nature of Web3 assets.

## 4. Data Sharing and Disclosure

Your data may be shared with the following parties:

- **Public Blockchain**: Since Web3 is decentralized, your Public Wallet Address and transaction data are inherently public and recorded on the relevant blockchain. This disclosure is outside our control.

- **Service Providers**: We engage third-party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service (e.g., cloud hosting, KYC/AML providers, data analytics, and payment processing). These parties have access to your data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.

- **Business Transfers**: In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company.

- **Legal Requirements**: If required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court order or government agency).


## 5. Your Data Protection Rights (GDPR/CCPA Focus)

Depending on your location, you may have the following rights regarding your Personal Data:

- **The Right to Access**: The right to request copies of your Personal Data.

- **The Right to Rectification**: The right to request correction of inaccurate data.

- **The Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten)**: The right to request that we erase your Personal Data, under certain conditions (note: this generally does not apply to data permanently recorded on the blockchain).

- **The Right to Object/Restrict Processing**: The right to object to or request that we restrict the processing of your Personal Data, under certain conditions.


## 6. Children's Privacy

Our Service is not directed at individuals under the age of 18 (or the legal age of majority in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 18. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from a child without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.

## 7. Data Retention

We will retain your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. Generally, we will retain account and PII data for the duration of your active account and for a reasonable period thereafter to comply with legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. Blockchain transaction data is permanently retained on the blockchain itself.
