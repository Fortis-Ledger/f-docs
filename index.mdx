# Welcome to FortisArena

## Two Platforms, One Ecosystem

FortisArena is a **dual-platform ecosystem** combining a **gamified social network** with a **professional esports tournament hub**. Both platforms share a unified wallet system but serve different purposes.

## 🎨 Platform 1: Social (Gamified)

A **reputation-based social network** where quality content unlocks features and ranks.

### The Philosophy

> **"Low-effort noise out, high-effort knowledge + skill in."**

Unlike traditional social media that rewards clickbait, we reward:
- **Knowledge sharing** (tutorials, guides)
- **Gaming skill** (strategy, analysis)
- **Educational content** (finance, learning)
- **Community value** (helping others)

### Rank System (0-4)

Progress by earning points through quality contributions:

| Rank | Name | Points | Key Unlock |
|:-----|:-----|:-------|:-----------|
| **0** | Observer | 0-100 | View & learn |
| **1** | Contributor | 100-500 | **Create posts** |
| **2** | Skilled | 500-2,000 | **Create reels** |
| **3** | Expert | 2,000-7,000 | **Create communities** |
| **4** | Authority | 7,000+ | **Revenue share** |
