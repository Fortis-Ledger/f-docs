# Blockchain Architecture

FortisArena utilizes a multi-chain strategy to ensure security, speed, and low transaction costs.

- **Binance Smart Chain (BSC)**: The primary home for the **$FRT** governance token, chosen for its low gas fees and high throughput.
- **Polygon (Matic)**: Utilized for high-frequency gameplay transactions to minimize costs for players.
- **Ethereum**: Bridged for maximum liquidity and interoperability with the broader DeFi ecosystem.

## Verified Contracts

We believe in "Can't be evil" over "Don't be evil". All our core logic is on-chain and verifiable.

### Core Contracts
