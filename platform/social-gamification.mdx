# Social Gamification System

FortisArena's social platform is built on a unique **gamified reputation system** where quality content and meaningful engagement are rewarded. Unlike traditional social media focused on vanity metrics, our platform prioritizes knowledge, skill, and genuine value.

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

> **"Low-effort noise out, high-effort knowledge + skill in."**

### What This Means

| ❌ Not Allowed | ✅ Encouraged |
|:--------------|:--------------|
| Daily vlogs without value | Gaming guides & tutorials |
| Personal drama/stories | Educational content |
| Reaction-only videos | Skill demonstrations |
| Face-based reels without purpose | Knowledge sharing |
| "Just vibes" content | Finance & Web3 education |
| Reposted memes | Original case studies |

## 🏆 Points System

### How Points Work

Points are earned through **quality contributions** and **meaningful engagement**. The system uses a sophisticated algorithm that considers:

1. **Content Quality Score (QS)**
2. **Engagement Weighting**
3. **Community Validation**
4. **Consistency**

### Content Quality Scoring

Every post receives a Quality Score based on:

| Factor | Weight | Description |
|:-------|:-------|:------------|
| **Content Type** | 40% | Category weight (Gaming, Knowledge, etc.) |
| **Originality** | 25% | AI-detected uniqueness |
| **Effort Signals** | 20% | Length, structure, media quality |
| **Community Feedback** | 15% | Reports, expert validation |

### Points by Action

#### Creating Content

| Action | Points | Requirements |
|:-------|:-------|:-------------|
| **High-Effort Post** | +30 | QS ≥ 80, approved by system |
| **Average Post** | +10 | QS 50-79, meets guidelines |
| **Low Effort** | 0 | QS < 50 |
| **Repost/Spam** | -15 | Duplicate or low-value content |
| **Off-Topic Abuse** | -30 | Wrong category posting |

#### Engagement (Anti-Fake Weighted)

| Interaction | Points | Why This Matters |
|:------------|:-------|:-----------------|
| **Meaningful Comment** | +5 | Min 20 chars + received likes |
| **Save/Bookmark** | +4 | Indicates high value |
| **Share with Caption** | +6 | Thoughtful distribution |
| **Like from High-Rank** | +3 | Quality validation |
| **Simple Like** | +1 | Basic engagement |
| **Emoji-only Comment** | +1 | Minimal engagement |

<Warning>
  **Bot Detection Active:** Fake engagement, purchased likes, and coordinated manipulation are detected and result in rank penalties or bans.
</Warning>

### Knowledge Boost Multiplier

When **3+ Experts (Rank 4)** mark a post as "High Value":
- Points earned: **×2 multiplier**
- Post gets **auto-pinned** in category
- Featured on discovery page
- Creator receives notification badge

## 💎 Seasonal Reset System

### How It Works

Every **3 months (Quarterly):**

| What Happens | Details |
|:-------------|:--------|
| **Points Partial Reset** | 70% of points above rank threshold retained |
| **Rank Maintenance** | Ranks preserved if activity maintained |
| **Activity Check** | Minimum engagement required to keep rank |
| **Fresh Start** | New quarter = new leaderboard opportunities |

### Example Reset

**Before Reset:**
- Rank 3 (Expert)
- 4,500 points

**After Reset:**
- Rank 3 maintained (if active)
- Points: 2,000 + (4,500 - 2,000) × 0.3 = 2,750 points

**Activity Requirement:**
- Rank 1: 3 posts or 20 engagements/quarter
- Rank 2: 5 posts or 50 engagements/quarter
- Rank 3: 2 communities active or 100 engagements/quarter
- Rank 4: 1 verified community or governance participation

### Why Reset?

1. **Prevents stagnation:** Old accounts don't dominate forever
2. **Rewards consistency:** Active users maintain advantage
3. **New opportunities:** Quarterly leaderboards reset
4. **Quality control:** Inactive high-ranks lose influence
