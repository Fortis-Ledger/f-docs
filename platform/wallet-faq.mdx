# Wallet FAQ

## General Questions

### Do I need MetaMask or any external wallet?

**No!** FortisArena provides everything. Your wallet is created automatically when you sign up. No seed phrases, no external apps, no gas fees for internal transfers.

### What's my wallet address?

You have a **UID** instead of a complex wallet address:
```
Format: FORTIS-UID-XXXX
Example: FORTIS-UID-7842
```

Use this UID to receive payments from other FortisArena users.

### Is there a mobile app for the wallet?

Yes! The wallet is fully integrated into the FortisArena mobile app (iOS & Android). Same features, optimized for mobile.

## Balances & Earnings

### What are the different balance types?

| Balance | What It Is | Can Withdraw? |
|:--------|:-----------|:--------------|
| **Fiat** | Bank withdrawable money | ✅ Yes |
| **FRT** | Governance token | ✅ Yes (crypto) |
| **FPT** | Tournament rewards | ✅ Yes (crypto) |
| **Points** | Social rank points | ❌ No (rank only) |

Once cleared, they move to your spendable balance.

### Can I convert between balance types?

Yes:
- **FRT ↔ FPT**: Internal swap (minimal fee)
- **Crypto → Fiat**: Sell function in wallet

## Technical

### What blockchain does Fortis use?

- **FRT & FPT**: BNB Smart Chain (BSC)
- **Supported deposits**: BSC, Polygon
- **Why BSC?**: Low gas fees, fast confirmation

### Can I deposit from any exchange?

Yes! Use these networks:
- **Binance**: BSC (BEP20)
- **Coinbase**: Send to Polygon address
- **Other exchanges**: Ensure BSC/Polygon network

**⚠️ Warning**: Sending on wrong network = Lost funds!

### What if I send crypto to the wrong address?

Unfortunately, **blockchain transactions are irreversible**. Always:
1. Double-check the address
2. Use copy-paste (not typing)
3. Send a small test amount first
4. Verify network (BSC/Polygon)

### Why is my deposit not showing?

Check:
1. **Confirmations**: BSC needs 15+ confirmations
2. **Network**: Did you use BSC/Polygon?
3. **Address**: Correct address?
4. **Time**: Can take up to 30 minutes

If still missing after 1 hour, contact support with tx hash.
