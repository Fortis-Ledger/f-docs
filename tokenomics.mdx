## Token Utility

The value of FRT is derived from its deep integration into the FortisArena ecosystem.

### Core Gameplay & Access
*   **Tournament Entry:** Pay FRT to enter exclusive tournaments with high prize pools.
*   **Premium Features:** Unlock advanced analytics, private lobbies, and other premium features by holding or spending FRT.

### Economic Incentives
*   **Staking:** Stake FRT in the FRTStaking contract to earn a share of the rewards pool.
*   **Rewards:** Earn FRT as prizes for winning tournaments and completing in-game challenges.

### Governance
*   **DAO Voting:** Hold FRT to vote on key platform decisions, such as new game integrations, feature development, and treasury spending.

## Deflationary Mechanism

*   **Buyback & Burn:** A portion of platform revenue will be used to systematically buy FRT from the open market and permanently burn it using the `burn()` function, reducing the total supply over time.

## Staking Pools

FRT holders can stake their tokens in the dedicated `FRTStaking` contract to earn rewards. Higher APY is offered for longer lock periods.

| Pool | Lock Duration | APY | Minimum Stake |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Flexible** | None | 10% | 1,000 FRT |
| **Bronze** | 30 Days | 15% | 1,000 FRT |
| **Silver** | 90 Days | 20% | 1,000 FRT |
| **Gold** | 180 Days | 25% | 1,000 FRT |
| **Platinum** | 365 Days | 30% | 1,000 FRT |

| **Multi-Sig Treasury** | Major funds secured in a multi-signature wallet (e.g., Gnosis Safe). |
| **Ownable2Step** | Ownership transfer requires a two-step process, preventing accidental transfers to wrong addresses. |
| **Launch Helper** | A dedicated `setLaunchAddresses()` function minimizes human error during the critical launch phase. |
| **Anti-Sniper Protection** | Early sniper bots are blocked for the first 3-5 blocks of trading. |
